= Srcdeps

A set of tools for building dependencies from their sources during the build.

= What is this good for?

Srcdeps alleviates some of the pains that arise from implementing Continuous Delivery in projects that use Maven-like
Artifacts. With srcdeps, a module can depend on a specific revision of another module. For instance, a module
`web-banking-frontend` could depend on `account-balance-microservice` at git revision `abc123`, without requiring the `account-balance-microservice` to perform a complete Maven release.


== Srcdeps support in build tools

Srcdeps is fully supported in Maven 3.3.1+. Please refer to
link:https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-maven[Srcdeps Maven] for details for to configure etc.

Although Gradle and sbt are not supported at this point, the link:https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-core[Srcdeps Core]
library has an ambition to be generic enough so that a support for other build tools can be added. Contributions are
welcome!
